I then have to call customer service, go through your ridiculous phone tree to get to a representative who then has to take a bunch of information and finally email my receipt. I do not get it. United emails my flight reservation receipts within minutes of clicking purchase. Why can not you do the same for inflight purchases like you used to?. Why make your customers go through so much trouble?. Why over tax what your customer service representatives with customer service issues like this?. I, like many, need these receipts for my business expense reports. They are important and need to be delivered to customers in a timely (same day) manner. I can not be the only one having this issue.

161,MUX,IAX,2022-09-21,Delayed,Delayed,Atlantic,"Hey United, love you, so some heart to heart feedback... I thought I was ""paying extra for"" the business / Polaris class ice cream sundae cart!. And I miss it!. It was your brand. Post Covid it has disappeared. It was missing my Houston London round-trip back in April-May 2020 also. United has lost something by losing the ice cream cart. Did some cost accountant make the call?. My hypothesis is deleting the ice cream cart is the wrong business value / branding decision. Context:. 1. A 1998 Harvard Business Review article on the turnaround of Continental gave a credo that the airline would provide whatever ""... the customer in Seat 9C ... would pay extra for."". Well for our African safari trip I was willing to pay out of my pocket - not corporate expense account - for seats 3F and 3L for my wife and me. And I had two flights where my experience was interrupted with the nagging thought, ""Dang, $22,000 and no frigging ice cream sundae service. What are they thinking?"". Reference: Right Away and All at Once: How We Saved Continental (hbr.org). https://hbr.org/1998/09/right-away-and-all-at-once-how-we-saved-continental. 2. I have been taking Continental / United business class since the 1990s, sometimes opting it over Singapore Airlines. I am Million Miles plus. For personal vacation travel I have bought ""business"" seats for my wife and me to Beijing in 2019 and London this year in addition to this trip Houston-Newark-Johannesburg-Frankfurt-Munich-Houston. 3. The sundae was not that expensive yet something I have always looked forward to on United (and previously Continental) long haul business flights. And while a little staff-time intensive, it provided good interaction staff-customer interaction and built for me brand goodwill. 4. Surprisingly the premade chocolate sundae tasted decent on this flight and did in many aspects hit the spot. It was a good portion. And in the day I did always skip the nuts and cherry. So are you wondering if the premade sundae of vanilla ice cream with cold fudge (no whipped cream) was nice enough why bother with giving this feedback?. Think of it this way... Post Covid people want a return to normalcy. Bringing back the ice cream sundae cart would be a great way for United to reassure their core customers that things are normal back in the Friendly Skies... serving up what the customer in seat 9C will ""pay extra for."".",90+,Is there anything else you'd like to share about the food & beverage served on your flight from [CITY] to [CITY]?,premier platinum,B767-300,Mainline,member
